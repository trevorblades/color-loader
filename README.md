# Color Loader

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/trevorblades/color-loader.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/trevorblades/color-loader)

A webpack loader that extracts the color palette of an image

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev color-loader file-loader
```

This loader depends on [`file-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader), so be sure to install that too if you don't have it already.

## Usage

This loader supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and SVG files and is designed to be a drop-in replacement for `file-loader`, in case you're already using that. The loader will output the path to the provided image file, along with information about the colors in the image.

```js
import image, {color, colors} from 'color-loader!./path/to/image.jpg';
```

 - `image` is the image path generated by the file loader
 - `color` is the most dominant color in the image
 - `colors` is an array of the dominant colors in the image

You can use it in your webpack configuration, too! This means that all images that you `import` or `require` will always return the colors extracted from the image.

```js
{
  // ...your awesome webpack config options
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.(jpg|png|gif|svg)$/,
        use: 'color-loader'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Options

You can pass along any options you would normally pass to [`file-loader`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader).

## Example

This image:

![example image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trevorblades/color-loader/master/example.png)

Will result in these colors:
 - ![#3a4f25](https://placehold.it/24/3a4f25/000000?text=+) #3a4f25
 - ![#b37a5d](https://placehold.it/24/b37a5d/000000?text=+) #b37a5d
 - ![#78993b](https://placehold.it/24/78993b/000000?text=+) #78993b
 - ![#839795](https://placehold.it/24/839795/000000?text=+) #839795
 - ![#8c472f](https://placehold.it/24/8c472f/000000?text=+) #8c472f

 You could use it in a React component like this:

 ```js
import image, {color} from './example.png';

const Component = () => (
  <div
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color, // #3a4f25
      backgroundImage: image
    }}
  >
    <h1>They ate the Pokémon...</h1>
  </div>
);
 ```
 
 And it might look something like this (results may vary):
